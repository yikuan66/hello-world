# hello-world
a place where I store ideas, resources, or share and discuss things with others

Hello! Here, I like to make some changes. First I want to define my topic as some guesses.
My major is physics, and I enjoy reading maths and physics books. I often think about the similarities between my guesses and readings, and try to modify my guesses with mathematics. I am interested in the quantum physics of the crystal structures such as La2CuO4.  We do not need to worry about the nucleus of the crystals because of Born-Oppenhenmer Approximation. What we need to do is to figure out the energy states of crystals.
